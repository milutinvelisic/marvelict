                     <div class="avengersContentRight">
                        <p>Reed Richards, Ben Grimm, Susan Storm, and her brother, Johnny Storm, were forever changed during an experimental space flight that exposed them to cosmic rays, which gave them super human powers and abilities. In the aftermath of their incredible journey, the four pledged to stay together as a team. They quickly became media sensations, and their celebrity status only grew as they explored the uncharted regions of the universe and confronted evil wherever they found it. But the Fantastic Four are more than just Super Heroes—they’re the first family of the Marvel Universe.</p>
                        <div class="avengersContentPic f4pic" id="blockf41" data-aos="zoom-in-right"></div>
                     </div>
                  </div>
                  <div class="avengersContent">
                     <div class="avengersContentLeft"></div>
                     <div class="avengersContentRight">
                        <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">During his time in college, Reed shared his dreams of space exploration with his friend, Ben. In turn, Ben pledged to fly any spaceship created by Reed. Susan was introduced to Reed when he was a house guest of her aunt, and through Sue, Richards met her younger brother, Johnny. Years later, Reed secured government financing for a new spaceship that could have potentially opened up interstellar travel for humanity.</p>
                        <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">However, the government pulled its funding from the project shortly before Reed completed his work. Desperate to test the ship before it was dismantled, Reed, Sue, Ben, and Johnny broke into the official facility and launched an unauthorized flight. Their mission was seemingly a success, but the ship’s shields failed to protect them from a massive dose of cosmic radiation. The vessel subsequently crashed back to Earth.</p>
                        <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">All four friends survived the experience, but Reed found his body had taken on elastic properties that allowed him to change his size and length. Susan gained the ability to turn invisible while Johnny attained control over fire. Tragically, Ben’s enhanced strength and durability gave his skin and body a rock-like appearance that robbed him of the ability to pass as human. Despite the sudden turn of events, the quartet realized the potential of their powers and chose to become a team.</p>
                        <div class="avengersContentPic f4pic" id="blockf42" data-aos="zoom-in-right"></div>
                     </div>
                  </div>
                  <div class="avengersContent">
                     <div class="avengersContentLeft"></div>
                     <div class="avengersContentRight">
                        <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">Upon their public debut, Reed took on the codename Mr. Fantastic, Susan became the Invisible Girl, Johnny claimed the original Human Torch’s name as his own, and Ben adopted the Thing as his persona. The Fantastic Four made an immediate splash by defeating the Mole Man and his army of monsters. They also became the first superhuman celebrities of the modern age of heroes.</p>
                        <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">All for Four</p>
                        <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">Because the Fantastic Four is first and foremost a family, they don’t have a traditional team dynamic. For their first few years together, Reed was the unquestioned patriarch of both the family and the group. Susan eventually chafed under Reed’s authority and left both him and the FF for a time. When she returned, Susan had a more equitable say in their personal and professional lives. Over time, Johnny and Ben have also gained bigger roles in the team’s direction.</p>
                        <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">All of the original members have served as team leaders. Outside of the founders, Black Panther and the second Ant-Man (Scott Lang) have also led their own incarnations of the Fantastic Four.</p>

                        <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">Doctor Doom may be the world’s most dangerous Super Villain, but his greatest rivalry is with Reed Richards and the Fantastic Four. Victor von Doom has tried to destroy the team on numerous occasions, and his hatred for Reed has been relentless. Even when Doom has been forced to work with the FF, his need to demonstrate his superiority over Richards has always ultimately destroyed their alliance.</p>
                        <div class="avengersContentPic f4pic" id="blockf44" data-aos="zoom-in-right"></div>

                        <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">Extended Family</p>
                        <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">Although Namor and the Silver Surfer were initially adversaries to the team, they have proven to be extremely reliable resources. Alicia Masters and Wyatt Wingfoot were associated with the FF largely through their romantic relationships with the Thing and She-Hulk, respectively. Johnny’s ex-wife, Lyja, was also close to the group even after she was exposed as an undercover Skrull operative who impersonated Alicia for an extended period. Doom’s heir, Kristoff Vernard, became close to the team when Reed and his “father” were believed to be dead. Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur were briefly substitute members of the team, while Spider-Man, Ghost Rider, Hulk, and Wolverine once formed a Fantastic Four of their own when they believed the original members had perished.</p>
                        <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">As Reed and Susan’s children, Franklin and Valeria Richards, have assumed larger roles in both the family and on the team, the Future Foundation was assembled to surround them with other gifted children to help solve the difficult problems facing humanity. The Foundation includes Alex Power, Dragon Man, Bentley 23, Artie Maddicks, Leech, Tong, Turg, Mik, Korr, Vii, and Wuu.</p>

                        <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">Family History</p>
                        <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">Years after graduating college, Reed Richards kept his promise to Ben Grimm by offering him the chance to be the test pilot for his experimental spaceship. Reed gained the financial backing of the government, but the project was abandoned shortly before its completion. Reed’s girlfriend, Susan Storm, and her younger brother, Johnny, volunteered to help Richards and Grimm fulfill their dream by breaking into the facility and taking the vessel for an authorized trip into space.</p>
                        <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">While the ship successfully reached orbit, it was almost immediately bombarded with cosmic rays. The intense radiation nearly incapacitated the crew, but Ben was able to return the vehicle to Earth without any fatalities. As the four emerged from the ship, they realized that they had been irrevocably changed by the experience and given super powers. Ben was particularly horrified by his transformation into the Thing, but he soon agreed to form a team with Reed as Mr. Fantastic, Susan as the Invisible Girl, and Johnny as the Human Torch.</p>
                        <div class="avengersContentPic f4pic" id="blockf45" data-aos="zoom-in-right"></div>
                     </div>
                  </div>
                  <div class="avengersContent">
                     <div class="avengersContentLeft"></div>
                     <div class="avengersContentRight">
                        <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">For the Fantastic Four’s first trial by fire, they were forced to battle the Mole Man and his army of monsters from the underground realm of Subterranea and Monster Isle. Soon after, the FF encountered the Skrulls for the first time and tricked an advance scout team into changing their bodies into cows before forgetting their true selves. The group didn’t attempt to hide their identities, and they embraced their public personas when the team relocated to New York City and moved into the Baxter Building.</p>
                        <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">Like many families, the FF had several conflicts with each other. Johnny and Ben developed a rivalry long before they became friends. While cooling off from one of his arguments with the team, Johnny encountered a vagrant who looked remarkably like Prince Namor, the Sub Mariner. Although Namor had no memory of his previous life as a prince of Atlantis and a World War II hero, Johnny sparked his memory by burning his excess hair away and dropping him in the ocean.</p>
                        <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">Johnny’s stunt spectacularly backfired when Namor discovered Atlantis was in ruins and he declared war on the surface world in retaliation for his loss. The Sub-Mariner became one of the FF’s first recurring foes, even though he clearly had romantic feelings for Susan. However, Namor’s threat paled in comparison to the emergence of Victor von Doom. Reed’s college rival returned as Doctor Doom and forced the team to travel back in time for his plans. Although the FF defeated Doom in their initial encounter, he went on to become their most enduring enemy.</p>
                        <div class="avengersContentPic f4pic" id="blockf46" data-aos="zoom-in-right"></div>
                     </div>
                  </div>
                  <div class="avengersContent">
                     <div class="avengersContentLeft"></div>
                     <div class="avengersContentRight">
                        <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">Doom and Namor teamed up to destroy the Fantastic Four, but the Sub-Mariner ultimately sided with his rivals when his would-be-ally betrayed him. The FF made a lot of enemies during their early adventures, including Red Ghost and the Super-Apes, Rama-Tut, the Impossible Man, the Molecule Man, and the Puppet Master. Alicia Masters, the Puppet Master’s blind stepdaughter, was used as a pawn in his first strike against the team. However, Alicia formed a bond with the Thing and a romance slowly bloomed between the two.</p>
                        <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">Wizard, Sandman, the Trapster, and Medusa formed the first Frightful Four as a dark counterpart to the FF. But Medusa had no memory of her Inhuman heritage and wasn’t evil like her companions. Reed and Sue’s relationship continued to advance and they got married in the Super Hero social event of the season. Even Doctor Doom’s attempt to overrun the wedding with Super Villains couldn’t completely disrupt the Richards’ big day.</p>
                        <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">The Inhuman known as Gorgon eventually located Medusa and attempted to reunite her with the rest of the royal family. Johnny quickly became infatuated with Medusa’s sister, Crystal, although Black Bolt and the remainder of her royal relatives disapproved of their burgeoning relationship. The FF and the royal family ultimately united against the threat of Black Bolt’s brother, Maximus the Mad. In the aftermath, the Inhumans were cut off from the outside world, leaving Johnny and Crystal separated and heartbroken.</p>
                        <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">Soon after, Uatu the Watcher went to great lengths to hide the Earth from Galactus and his herald, the Silver Surfer. When the FF confronted the Surfer, they were unable to prevent him from summoning Galactus to devour the world. Alicia befriended the Surfer as he recovered from the Thing’s attack and allowed him to see the good in humanity. Meanwhile, Uatu sent Johnny on a mission inside of Galactus’ ship to retrieve the Ultimate Nullifier, a weapon powerful enough to annihilate even the cosmic giant—and the Earth itself.</p>
                        <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">Anspired by Alicia, the Silver Surfer turned against his master and acted in defense of the Earth. In response, Galactus banished the Surfer behind an impenetrable barrier that prevented him from returning to the stars.</p>
