                        <p>The Guardians of the Galaxy’s origins can be traced to Earth native Peter Quill, AKA Star-Lord, betraying Yondu Udontu and his Ravagers and pre-emptively stealing a valuable Orb they were after. In retaliation, Yondu put a bounty on Quill’s head, which mercenaries Rocket and Groot were eager to claim.</p>
                        <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">Also on Quill’s tail was Gamora, a warrior assassin and adoptive daughter to Thanos. She had been loaned out as muscle to the Kree zealot Ronan the Accuser in order to help him track down the Orb. Gamora decided to betray Ronan and Thanos, not wishing the Orb and its potentially lethal power to get in their hands, and made a deal to sell the Orb to a being known as the Collector.</p>
                        <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">On Xandar, Quill and Gamora battled over the Orb, as Rocket and Groot intervened to detain Quill. During their skirmish, they were all captured by the Nova Corps and arrested. The four were sent to a high security prison, the Kyln, where they were joined by fellow prisoner Drax, whose family had been killed thanks to Thanos and Ronan. While locked up, the wary partners formulated their escape and a plan to sell the Orb and split the profits. In the wake of their breakout, the five outlaws would all come realize the threat Ronan held, and put their own lives on the line to stop him, in the process becoming the Guardians of the Galaxy.</p>

                        <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">While the team has, in theory, redeemed themselves for earlier crimes, and were pardoned by the Nova Corps, they frequently continue to operate outside the law. The group often work for money, taking jobs from wealthy clients like the Sovereign high priestess, Ayesha. They will also do good deeds without the promise of payment, though often with the hope that a reward will be included in the long run.       </p>

He will stop at nothing to get ahold of all six Infinity Stones, which puts him in conflict with the Guardians, and inadvertently sets into motion the events that bring them together.</p>
                        <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">Ronan the Accuser of the Kree Empire is a radical zealot who first works for Thanos to gain possession of the Power Stone, before deciding he wants it for himself. After Gamora betrays him, the Guardians battle Ronan for control of the Power Stone.</p>

After they defeat the Abilisk, Rocket steals some of those same batteries, leading the Sovereign to hunt the team.</p>
                        <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">Ego is a Celestial being, and biological father of Peter Quill. He attempts to conquer the universe with Quill’s help, but the Guardians stand against him when the truth of his intentions is revealed.</p>
                        <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">Yondu Udontu straddles the ally and enemy roles depending on his mood and the payoff, but he ultimately ends up an ally of the Guardians—first helping them against Ronan in order to profit from the Orb, and then making a stand for good against Ego.</p>

                        <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">The Nova Corps are an intergalactic armed force led by Nova Prime. Initially pitted against each other, they become allies with the Guardians when the latter work with them to protect Xandar from Ronan’s plan to annihilate the planet. Corpsmen Dey and Denarian Saal specifically are among the Nova Corps officers that detain the outlaws, but later team up with them against Ronan.</p>
                        <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">Nebula, like Gamora, is Thanos’ adoptive daughter, and is similarly cybernetically enhanced and trained as an assassin. While she is first an enemy of the Guardians, assisting Ronan, she and Gamora mend fences, and she eventually becomes an ally against both Ego and Thanos.</p>
                        <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">During their detainment in the Kyln, Gamora, Quill, and the duo of Rocket and Groot agreed to work together to escape and then sell the Orb Quill had stolen. They were joined by fellow prisoner Drax, whose own family had been killed by Thanos and Ronan. After Drax was convinced that Gamora too, despite her previous affiliation, was an enemy of Thanos and Ronan, the five outlaws broke out together.</p>

                        <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">On Knowhere, the group met with their buyer, Taneleer Tivan, the Collector. He revealed to them that the Orb held the Power Stone, an Infinity Stone capable of mowing down entire civilizations. Before their deal was completed, Tivan’s slave, Carina, attempting to strike back at Tivan, grabbed for the stone, only for it kill her and destroy Tivan’s museum. The sale to Tivan disrupted, the group debated what to do with the Orb, with Gamora insisting that it go to the Nova Corp and stay out of Ronan’s hands.</p>
                        <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">When both Ronan and Yondu separately arrived seeking the outlaws and the Orb, a space battle ensued. Gamora implored with Nebula to prevent Ronan from obtaining the stone, but Nebula instead shot her sister’s craft, sending Gamora into space while Nebula retrieved the Orb. Quill exited his pod to save Gamora, nearly sacrificing himself in the process.</p>

                        <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">Unfortunately, the group arrived on Knowhere too late. Though Thanos first fooled them with an illusion that made it seem like he didn’t have the Reality Stone yet, and that Gamora was able to fatally stab him, in truth he had already gotten the stone and laid waste to Knowhere. When Gamora was grabbed by Thanos, Quill reluctantly tried to shoot her, as promised, only for Thanos to turn his blast into harmless bubbles and teleport himself and Gamora away.</p>
                        <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">On Nidavellir, Rocket used his ship to assist Thor and the dwarf Eitri to create a new axe for Thor, Stormbreaker. Thor nearly died making the weapon, and Groot—until this point acting uninterested in the events around him—used his own arm to make the axe’s handle.</p>
                        <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">As Thanos’ prisoner, Gamora learned he also had captured Nebula, and seeing her sister tortured caused Gamora to give Thanos the location of the Soul Stone. On the planet Vormir, Thanos learned he must sacrifice something he loved to gain possession of the Soul Stone, and threw Gamora from a cliff, proving he truly loved her in the same moment he ended her life.</p>
                        <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">On Thanos’ home planet, Titan, Quill, Mantis, and Drax encountered Earth heroes Iron Man, Doctor Strange and Spider-Man and initially battled them, before they realized they were are all enemies of Thanos. Quill came up with a plan to wrest the Infinity Gauntlet from Thanos when he arrived to take possession of the Time Stone from Doctor Strange. Joined by Nebula, the group nearly succeeded in stopping Thanos. When Quill learned Thanos had killed Gamora, his rage caused him to strike out, breaking the hold Mantis had on Thanos, who fought back at full strength. With Strange trading the Time Stone for Iron Man’s life, Thanos departed for Earth, with an incredulous Star-Lord asking if they just lost.</p>
                        <p data-aos="zoom-in-right">On Earth, Thor, Rocket, and Groot fought Thanos’ forces alongside several Avengers and their allies in Wakanda, with their arrival turning the tide of the battle. However, when Thanos arrived, he was able to get the Mind Stone, the last of the Infinity Stones he desired. With a snap of his fingers, he ended half the life in the universe, including Groot, who disintegrated into nothingness, along with many others on the battlefield. On Titan, the same tragic fate befell Star-Lord, Mantis, and Drax, leaving Rocket as the last surviving member of the Guardians of the Galaxy.</p>
